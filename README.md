# SecondHand
Add seconds and date to status bar clock on TrollStore devices
Compatible with iOS 14.0-15.4.1

In order for it to run in the background, you must set location services to **Always**, and you can enable notifications so that you can be notified when the app stops running.
No information will leave your device. It is only to keep the app open.

**Info:** Your battery life may be impacted when using seconds. Battery drain is negligible with Date though, because it only updates every hour.

I am not responsible for damage to your device.
